Project Overview

This project aims to predict CO2 emissions of vehicles based on their technical specifications such as engine size, fuel type, transmission, and fuel consumption. Leveraging the Multiple Linear Regression algorithm, the model achieves a high determination coefficient (R2), providing a data-driven approach to automotive sustainability.
Key Features

    Data Preprocessing: Handled categorical variables using OneHotEncoder and ColumnTransformer.

    Model Training: Implemented a Scikit-Learn based Linear Regression model.

    Evaluation: Achieved an R2 score of 99.4%, demonstrating a near-perfect correlation between fuel consumption and emissions.

    Sustainability Focus: Designed to support "Green Automotive" initiatives by analyzing carbon footprints.

Tech Stack

    Language: Python

    Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

    Environment: Google Antigravity IDE

Results

The model's performance indicates that fuel consumption patterns and engine characteristics are primary predictors of environmental impact. This tool can be utilized by automotive engineers to optimize vehicle designs for lower emissions.
